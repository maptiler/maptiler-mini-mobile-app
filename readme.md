# MapTiler SDK PWA Demo
This is a minimalist test app using MapTiler SDK (JS/TS) with Capacitor.

With the command `npm run sync`, Capacitor re-prepare the two projects: iOS and Android.

Those project must then be opened in their respective build environment (XCode and Android Studio) where they can be built and tested.

For Android, it is pretty straightforward to build the APK file so it was built and placed in the apk folder.
